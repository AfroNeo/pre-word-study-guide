## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
To learn as much as possible with a short space of time about the process of making a website.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I am passionate about the learning element. This was just to scratch the surface.
- What problem does it solve?
I learnt the process of debugging, arraying, pulling and pushing work to github solving the merging issue by being on the 'main' not the 'master' because my first HTML issue was unsuccessful at merging and now I may have lost that original task.
- What did you learn?
I learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the web applications in association with the tasks at hand, all very fascinating stuff moving at fast pace. I learn how to operate the terminal by using the correct commands and to navigate accordingly. Still much practice is to be done. This is only week one and I have not lost interest.


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
Each section contained notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
